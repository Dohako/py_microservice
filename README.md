# Microservice test on python

Testing microservice arch with next stack:

* python(fastapi)
* psql(alchemy)
* docker
* rest api
* nginx

___
This repo is made for selftraining in widespread nowadays microservice architecture. My personal opinion: I really like the ideas that SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) stands for. From my point of view, splitting the functionality of a large application into different smaller ones is a great approach.

Microservices is meant to split large applications monolith to smaller applications that in whole will represent same functionality.
