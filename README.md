This repo is made for selftraining in widespread nowadays microservice architecture. My personal opinion: I really like the ideas that SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) stands for. From my point of view, splitting the functionality of a large application into different smaller ones is a great approach.

Also here I will store some of information about SOA so I(and maybe not me alone) could check it any time needed.
